    Evaluation (input list should contain existing as well as the new roles that
    need to be provisioned).

    filtered, e.g. results could be provided only on newly added roles.

    `endpoint` - Name of the Endpoint corresponding to the Security System. 

    Optional params:

    `ruleset` - Ruleset name, if not provided, system will use the default
    ruleset.
