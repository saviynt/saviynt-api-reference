  summary: Transport Status
  description: >-
    This API obtains the status of the transport request (import, export, or
    transfer), and helps in confirming whether the transport was completed
    successfully or failed.

    **Note**: This API returns the status of only those requests that have been
    processed using the Enhanced Transport feature.

    The `Authorization` must have `Bearer` followed by `Token`.

    Mandatory params:

    `operation` - enter the type of transport request (export, import, or
    transfer)   `filename` - enter the transport package zip file name in full
    (including the .zip extension)   `requestid`(required only if the operation
    is import) - enter the request ID generated during the submission of the
    import request
